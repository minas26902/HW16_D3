# HW16_D3
In this exercise I used data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Prevalence Data to see if there was a correlation between people that work from home (non-commuters) and the frequency of their physical activity. A scatterplot created using D3.js shows the correlation between these two datasets with each circle representing the population from each state in the United States.
