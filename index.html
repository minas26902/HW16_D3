        <p>The scatterplot above indicates that there is a positive correlation (0.81) between the percent of 
            a population that works from home and the percent of population that has done some type of physical
            activity in the past month. One explanation is that people who work from have a more flexible schedule 
            and spend less time on the road commuting, allowing them to have time in the day to do other activities,
            such as exercising. But there are other variables such as climate (not shown here) that may also explain
            why people in some states are more active than people in other states. The states with the highest 
            percentage of "active" people were Vermont and Colorado, whereas the states with the lowest number of "active" 
            people were Puerto Rico and Mississippi.</p>
